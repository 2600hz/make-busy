# TODO

1. Somehow indicate a dirty state after test (e.g. env should be re-created)?
2. Language bs is not found (voicemail tests, trying to say user name)
4. Somehow sync with Kazoo events (e.g. voicemail stored and is available)
5. Review and add more basic test cases (e.g. call between accounts, federation?)
6. Don'do hupall, select and drop account channels (forge channel uuid/track channels)?
7. Reset Voicemailbox to initial state, more sane way
9. Creeate binary docker images and publish them to Docker Hub
10. Run makebusy docker without apache (with php -S), and under user rights
11. Add Trunkstore entities to account
12. Add user's device as user method createDevice (instead of account)
13. Rename KazooGateways to reflect the purpose (load Kazoo's data for account)
14. Bind systemconfigs to account
